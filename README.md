Please run all IPYNB files using Google Colab.
Also, please note that you will require your own Kaggle Username and API key in order for the code to automatically download the dataset. You can still manually
download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia if you wish, but if you do this make sure to place it in the 
correct directory.
